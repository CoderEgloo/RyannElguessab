    <h2>Magic Code Ball</h2>
    <h3>This is one of my first projects in Javascript where I make my take on the classic magic 8 ball but with much more variety. Everytime the user clicks the button a font, color, and "fortune" will be randomly selected from a list and then displayed to the end user. Its a pretty simple script but I had a lot of fun making it and learned some of the basics of integraging Javascript with HTML and CSS.</h3>

    <h2>Password Generator</h2>
    <h3>This was my second project with Javascript. Many of the concepts are the same as my first JS project, selecting a element  from a list at index x and displaying it. In this project I did delve a little more in JS by making the password automatically copy to the clipboard for ease of use.</h3>

    <h2>Twitter Profile Scraper</h2>
    <h3>After mastering the basics of Javascript's capability within static HMTL pages, I decided to return to Python. I never tried modules outside those built into Python and was astonished what I could do with a little patience. In this project, I used Selenium to operate the driver, Pillow to display the pack image, and Tkinter to display the user interface. The user enters in a Twitter handle, which the program will take to go to the user's page to screenshot the profile bar and save it as a .png image. <br> Here is a link to my code</h3>
    
    <h2>Resource Packs</h2>
    <h3>I grew up playing Minecraft and enjoyed the creativity that it gave me. I had a lot more fun utilizing my creativity to make minecraft resource packs. (modifications to the game's default textures) The majority of Minecraft players use texturepacks to alter their gameplay. Utilizing a popular mod called Optifine, I was able to import my own 3-D models into the game. Due to Minecraft's simplistic style I was able to learn low-poly modeling, hopefully preparing me for the more advanced programs like Blender that I plan to learn in the future. To this day, I have over
